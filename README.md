# Matplotlib-challenge

A very challenging task, as it is about pure statistics in a medical study for certain drugs against a type of skin cancer.
The first challenge was to make on Data Frame of the two csv files given, then it was about determining ig all the rows were usefull. I did not want to erase anything so I prefere to make small data sets of the original dataframe
The second challenge was to make the same graph with pandas and with matplotlib.
The third challenge was to make the code to get the Quartiles, Outliers and Boxplots. I found this task really challenging as I know how to make it in paper but make the code to do it, made me re-watch the previous jupyter notebooks we studied with in class.
The last challenge was in how to code the line equation for the correlation between the mouse weight and the average volume of the tumors.
